// Problem 5
// Temperature Range: determine if a given temperature is within a
// comfortable range for outdoor activities. If the temperature is between 65Â°F
// and 85Â°F (temperature >= 65 && temperature <= 85), it's considered
// comfortable. If it's outside this range, it's either too hot or too cold for
// outdoor activities.
